# Memory

Memory game created with Python and Pygame. Feels good to make my own game from the ground up! Graphics and animations become much more complex when you have to draw everything meticulously yourself. :]

<b>Features:</b>
* Randomized card colors/icons
* Animations for hiding/showing cards, winning the game, beginning the game
* Hover effect
* Dynamically updating score
* Playtime tracking to let you know how quickly all matches were completed
* Drop shadow effect on board and cards

<b>Requirements:</b>
* Python 3.4
* PyGame 1.9.2a0
  <blockquote>Use the unofficial pygame build for Python 3.4 from here: http://www.lfd.uci.edu/~gohlke/pythonlibs/#pygame</blockquote>

<b>Installing Unofficial pygame for Python 3.4:</b>
* Save .whl file from above to somewhere you'll remember
* Open a terminal
* Enter: 'pip install wheel' (without quotes)
* Navigate to the previous directory with .whl file
* Enter: 'pip install some-package.whl' (without quotes)


Usage: <blockquote>python memory.py</blockquote>
